# Data-Cleaning
This project focuses on the essential process of data cleaning, where messy, incomplete, or inconsistent data is transformed into a reliable and structured format. Key tasks include handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing outliers. The goal is to ensure the dataset's accuracy and integrity, laying a solid foundation for meaningful analysis and decision-making.

**1.Data Inspection:**
Load the dataset and examine its structure to understand its content and identify potential issues like missing values or inconsistencies.

**2.Handling Missing Data:**
Identify missing or null values in the dataset and decide how to address them (e.g., impute values, drop rows/columns, or leave them).

**3.Removing Duplicates:**
Find and eliminate duplicate records to ensure each data entry is unique and not repeated.

**4.Standardizing Data:**
Ensure consistency across the dataset by standardizing formats, such as converting dates into a uniform format or ensuring consistent text capitalization.

**5.Outlier Detection:**
Identify outliers or extreme values that could distort analysis, then decide whether to remove, adjust, or keep them based on their relevance.

**6.Final Checks and Validation:**
Perform a final review to verify that the data is clean, complete, and ready for analysis, ensuring no issues were missed.
